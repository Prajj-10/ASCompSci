# Declaration and initialization of a variable
PI = 3.14  # The identifier's name is in all Caps, hence this must be treated as a constant.

a = 34  # Assigning 34 to a variable called a.

b = 50

# Basic Arithmetic operations

c = a + b  # Addition of numbers
d = b - a  # Subtraction of numbers
e = b * a  # Multiplication of numbers
f = b / a  # Division of numbers

# Further arithmetic operations

g = b ** a  # Exponent of b^a
h = b // a  # Integer division of b/a (Store the whole number of the quotient)
i = b % a   # Modulus of b and a (Stores remainder in i.)

# Printing values.
